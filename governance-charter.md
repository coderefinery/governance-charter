# Governance charter for the CodeRefinery organization

**THIS DOCUMENT IS A DRAFT.** Please see the README on how and where to suggest changes.

**Purpose of this document**. The purpose is to make a way for others (not part
of the 2016-2024 NeIC collaboration agreements) to take a formal part of
CodeRefinery. With this document we wish to make it easier for organizations
and individuals to commit resources to CodeRefinery. It is a basic outline to
get started, and it's up to the Steering Committee to develop procedures as
CodeRefinery evolves.

**Connection to funding structure**. This charter assumes as a starting point
that most of the work is contributed in-kind while coordination and community
management may be centrally funded (this is the case 2022-2025). We expect the
governance charter to evolve with an evolving funding structure.

This is the governance charter for CodeRefinery.  It is modeled after the
[Minimum Viable
Governance](https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/)
(CC-BY) with inspiration from other sources (see the end of this document).


## 0. Changes from the steering model 2016-2024

* 2016-2024 the project was/is managed using the [PPS model](https://www.tietoevry.com/en/create/pps/) developed by Tieto-Evry which is used for all NeIC-funded projects. The present document and charter does not have to replace the PPS model and can be used as a complementary model. PPS can be used at the interface NeIC-CodeRefinery while the present governance charter is the more community-facing collaboration and steering model.
* It is possible for other partners to join the Steering Committee (and with that, bring more resources). There is at least one community member elected to the steering committee.
* The Steering Committee should take a more active role in advising the future directions of CodeRefinery (especially about collaborations and what counts as a "CodeRefinery workshop").
* The community has more say. The community already essentially decides the direction, but there isn't much connection to the Steering Committee and this charter tries to improve this.


## 1. Mission, vision, and guiding principles

**1.1 Mission** (what we do and why we do it):

- We create a highly skilled academic community who can do better, more reproducible science.
- Promote reproducible science through training and community engagement. Foster a culture of FAIRness, collaboration, and openness in research software practices.
- We want to improve research by providing education in the tools of computational science to a diverse audience.
- We fill gaps between academia's lack of training in certain areas and prepare people and communities for fields such as  high-performance computing and AI.

**1.2 Vision** (what we want to achieve):

- We will continue giving courses like we have been doing, but with more possibility of new partners joining and custom teaching styles, including small local courses.
- We have a wide variety of other rotating workshops, organized by partners but with contribution by many.
- Our core workshops are a regular recommendation for any students or researchers doing computational research. When research projects need extra training, they think of us and our team.
- Improved teaching skills among CodeRefinery staff.

**1.3 Guiding principles** (when a difficult decision needs to be made, we invoke the following guiding principles):

- At our core, we are an open project and structure our working methods like one. Our outputs are openly licensed with distributed copyright. Encourage and simplify collaboration.
- We optimize for practical usability for beginners in reproducible computational work. We do not try to replace career-oriented IT training. (The CodeRefinery community does help with other advanced courses).
- When in doubt, do whatscience/research/academics need right now to increase the integrity of their science.
- Data, software, and documents created by the organization are shared as open as possible and as closed as necessary.


## 2. Outline of the organization structure

CodeRefinery is operated as an open-source project with an open community membership of individuals and organizational partners.

- **Partner institutions**: The institutions that collaborate.
- **Steering Committee**: Provides high-level strategy and help. Can be consulted on big decisions and for tricky trade-offs. Within the mission statement, delegates day to day decisions to Community Managers.
- **Community Managers**: Manage day-to-day work and connection with the steering committee. Build consensus among those doing the actual work for the day-to-day operations.
- **Community**: Does most of the work and should be recognized for their work. The Steering Committee should agree on some appropriate way to recognize community members.


## 3. Steering Committee

**3.1 Purpose and responsibilities** (responsibilities may be delegated to the Community Managers):

- Strategic and organizational planning
  - Project approval and oversight
  - Policy oversight
  - Coordinate community initiatives
  - Fostering collaboration among members (within and outside of CodeRefinery)
  - Ensuring the effective implementation of community objectives
  - Steering the lesson portfolio
  - Provide a contact point
- Overseeing contributions
  - Confirms partner-level contributions.
  - Confirms Community Managers (likely with the community's input) and delegates most daily operations to them.
  - Guides the definition of the CodeRefinery community
  - Guides how cross-organization events should be reported to make sure that credit goes to the right place
- Managing the brand
  - Trademark management: Name, brand, and public image
  - Manage intellectual property with a distributed ownership model
  - Guides the definition of what event can be called “CodeRefinery workshop”
- Technical oversight
  - Manage accounts: Freshdesk, Twitter, Fosstodon, GitHub, domain name registration, HackMD, HedgeDoc, Indico, chat, mailing lists, GitLab, YouTube
  - Manage the data and data sharing policies
  - Manage transferring the GitLab service to another organization
- Financial oversight
  - Make agreements on behalf of CodeRefinery
  - Business plan and budget plan
  - Capacity plan
  - Works with organizational partners to define in-kind contributions and roles

**3.2 Composition**.

- Each funding partner has the right to appoint a member of the Steering Committee. Initial composition is one person per funding organization of the NeIC project (phase 3).
- The Steering Committee should consist of a minimum 3 persons.
- At least one Steering Committee member is elected by the community.
- The Steering Committee appoints a Chair responsible for organizing Steering Committee activity.
- The Steering Committee will meet at least twice a year to discuss high-level matters and the broad direction. Institutional items shall include a yearly report (first meeting) and a commitment to budget for upcoming year (second meeting).

**3.3 Termination of membership**. The membership can be terminated by a
written notice of resignation to the Steering Committee.  If a member is
unresponsive for more than three months the Steering Committee may vote to
remove the member.

**3.4. Decision making**. The Steering Committee will strive for all decisions
to be made by consensus. While explicit agreement of the entire Steering
Committee is preferred, it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Steering
Committee will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a
number of factors, including the dominant view of the Steering Committee and
nature of support and objections. The Steering Committee will document evidence
of consensus in accordance with these requirements. If consensus cannot be
reached, the Steering Committee will make the decision by a vote.

**3.5. Voting**. The Steering Committee Chair will call a vote with reasonable
notice to the Steering Committee, setting out a discussion period and a
separate voting period. Any discussion may be conducted in person or
electronically by text, voice, or video. The discussion will be open to the
public. In any vote, each voting representative will have one vote. Except as
specifically noted elsewhere in this charter, decisions by vote require a
simple majority vote of all voting members.


## 4. Community Managers

- Coordinate the project on a day-to-day basis.
- Appointed by the Steering Committee (with consultation of the community).
- Report to and work with the Steering Committee, but mainly lead the community in doing the work.
- Ensure rough consensus and push things forward if it can't be done.
- Can appoint leads in different areas.


## 5. Community

- Community does most of the work, and should be recognized as decided by the Community Managers and Steering Committee.
- This is a volunteer organization, and volunteer members do not have any requirement to do anything apart from following this charter and our code of conduct.


## 6. Code of conduct

All organization members are expected to abide by our community standards of cooperation and respect, outlined in our [code of conduct](https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/).


## 7. Trademarks

Any names, trademarks, service marks, logos, mascots, or similar indicators of
source or origin and the goodwill associated with them arising out of
CodeRefinery activities or CodeRefinery projects' activities (the "Marks"), are
controlled by the Organization. Steering Committee members may only use the
Marks in accordance with the Organization's trademark policy (which needs to be
worked out). If a Steering Committee member is terminated or removed from the
Steering Committee, any rights the Steering Committee member may have in the
Marks revert to the Organization.

Since CodeRefinery is not a legal entity, we aren't taking ownership in the
legal sense but making an informal agreement about how the name and brand will
be used. The Steering Committee can propose formalization towards a legal
entity if/when they decide it is needed.


## 8. Amendments

Amendments to this charter may only be made with at least a 3/4 affirmative
vote of the Steering Committee.
