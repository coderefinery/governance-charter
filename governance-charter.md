# Governance charter for the CodeRefinery organization

**THIS DOCUMENT IS A DRAFT.** Please see the README on how and where
to suggest changes.

---

This is the governance charter for CodeRefinery.  It is modeled after the
[Minimum Viable
Governance](https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/)
(CC-BY) with inspiration from other sources (see the end of this document).


## 1. Mission, vision, and guiding principles

**1.1 Mission** (what we do and why we do it):

- We want to promote reproducible science through training and community engagement.
- We will continue giving courses like we have been doing (but with more
  possibility of new partners joining and custom teaching styles, including
  small local courses).
- We want to improve research by providing education in the tools of computational science to a diverse audience.
- We fill gaps between academia's lack of training in certain areas.
- We prepare people and communities for high-performance computing and AI.
- We foster a culture of FAIRness, collaboration, and openness in research software practices.


**1.2 Vision** (what we want to achieve):

- We create a highly skilled academic community who can do better, more reproducible science.
- Our core workshops are a regular recommendation for any students or researchers doing computational research.
- We have a wide variety of other rotating workshops, organized by partners but with contribution by many.
- When research projects need extra training, they think of us and our team.
- Skilled trainers and build knowledge transfer and build competence.
- Highly skilled researchers and staff.
- Create a group of good trainers in partner institutes.
- Bringing academia into the digital age.
- Equip society with tools for collaborative and reusable research.


**1.3 Guiding principles** (when a difficult decision needs to be made, we invoke the following guiding principles):

- At our core, we are an open project and structure our working methods like
  one. Our outputs are openly licensed with distributed copyright.
- We optimize for practical usability for those who lack skills in reproducible
  computational work. We do not try to replace career-oriented IT training.
- When in doubt, do what makes science/research/academics more reproducible.
- Make it easier for people and organizations to participate.
- Encourage collaboration and simplify collaboration when possible to do so.
- Use only the following outbound licenses unless otherwise approved:
  - For code, a license on the Open Source Initiative's list of [popular licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses).
  - For data, a license on the Open Knowledge Foundation's list of [recommended conformant licenses](http://opendefinition.org/licenses/).


## 2. Outline of the organization structure

CodeRefinery is operated as an open-source project with an open community
membership of individuals and organizational partners.

- **Partners**: The institutions that collaborate, and unaffiliated individuals.
- **Steering Committee**: Provides high-level strategy and help. Can be
  consulted on big decisions and for tricky trade-offs. Within the mission
  statement, delegates all other decisions to Community Managers.
- **Community Managers**: Manage day-to-day work and connection with the
  steering committee. Build consensus among those doing the actual work for the
  day-to-day operations.
- **Community**: Does mots of the work and should be recognized for their work.


## 3. Steering Committee

**3.1 Purpose and responsibilities** (responsibilities may be delegated to the Community Managers):

- Strategic and organizational planning
- Project approval and oversight
- Policy oversight
- Confirms Community Managers (likely with the community's input) and delegates most daily operations to them.
- Technical oversight
- Trademark management: Name, brand, and public image
- Manage intellectual property with a distributed ownership model
- Make agreements on behalf of CodeRefinery.
- Financial oversight
- Business plan and budget plan
- Capacity plan
- Works with organizational partners to define in-kind contributions and roles.
- Coordinate community initiatives
- Confirms partner-level contributions.
- Steering the lesson portfolio
- Fostering collaboration among members
- Ensuring the effective implementation of community objectives
- Manage accounts: Freshdesk, Twitter, Fosstodon, GitHub, domain name
  registration, HackMD, HedgeDoc, Indico, chat, mailing lists, GitLab, YouTube
- Provide a contact point
- Manage the data and data sharing policies
- Manage transferring the GitLab service to another organization

**3.2 Composition**.
- Each funding partner has the right to appoint a member of the Steering Committee.
  Initial composition is one person per funding organization of the NeIC project (phase 3).
- The Steering Committee should consist of a minimum 3 persons.
- At least one Steering Committee member is elected by the community.
- The Steering Committee appoints a Chair responsible for organizing Steering Committee activity.
- The Steering Committee will meet at least twice a year to discuss high-level
  matters and the broad direction. Institutional items shall include a yearly
  report (first meeting) and a commitment to budget for upcoming year (second
  meeting).

**3.3 Termination of membership**. The membership can be terminated by a
written notice of resignation to the Steering Committee.  If a member is
unresponsive for more than three months the Steering Committee may vote to
remove the member.

**3.4. Decision making**. The Steering Committee will strive for all decisions
to be made by consensus. While explicit agreement of the entire Steering
Committee is preferred, it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Steering
Committee will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a
number of factors, including the dominant view of the Steering Committee and
nature of support and objections. The Steering Committee will document evidence
of consensus in accordance with these requirements. If consensus cannot be
reached, the Steering Committee will make the decision by a vote.

**3.5. Voting**. The Steering Committee Chair will call a vote with reasonable
notice to the Steering Committee, setting out a discussion period and a
separate voting period. Any discussion may be conducted in person or
electronically by text, voice, or video. The discussion will be open to the
public. In any vote, each voting representative will have one vote. Except as
specifically noted elsewhere in this charter, decisions by vote require a
simple majority vote of all voting members.


## 4. Community Managers

- Coordinate the project on a day-to-day basis.
- Appointed by the Steering Committee (with consultation of the community).
- Report to and work with the Steering Committee, but mainly lead the community in doing the work.
- Ensure rough consensus and push things forward if it can't be done.
- Can appoint leads in different areas.


## 5. Community

- Community does most of the work, and should be recognized as decided by the
  Community Managers and Steering Committee.
- This is a volunteer organization, and volunteer members do not have any
  requirement to do anything apart from following this charter and our code of
  conduct.


## 6. Code of conduct

All organization members are expected to abide by our community standards of
cooperation and respect, outlined in our [code of
conduct](https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/).


## 7. Trademarks

Any names, trademarks, service marks, logos, mascots, or similar indicators of
source or origin and the goodwill associated with them arising out of
CodeRefinery activities or CodeRefinery projects' activities (the "Marks"),
are controlled by the Organization. Steering Committee members may only use the
Marks in accordance with the Organization's trademark policy (which needs to be
worked out). If a Steering Committee member is terminated or removed from the
Steering Committee, any rights the Steering Committee member may have in the
Marks revert to the Organization.


## 8. Amendments

Amendments to this charter may only be made with at least a 3/4 affirmative
vote of the Steering Committee.
